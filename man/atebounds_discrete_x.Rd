\title{Bounding the average treatment effect (ATE) with discrete covariates}
\usage{
atebounds_discrete_x(Y, D, X, rps, Q = 2L, studentize = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{n-dimensional vector of binary outcomes}

\item{D}{n-dimensional vector of binary treatments}

\item{X}{n by p matrix of covariates}

\item{rps}{n-dimensional vector of reference propensity scores}

\item{Q}{polynomial order that uses the (Q-1) nearest neighbors excluding own observations (default: Q = 2)}

\item{studentize}{TRUE if X is studentized elementwise and FALSE if not (default: TRUE)}

\item{alpha}{(1-alpha) nominal coverage probability for the confidence interval for ATE (default: 0.05)}
}
\value{
An S3 object of type "ATbounds". The object has the following elements.
\item{y1_lb}{the lower bound on the average of Y(1), i.e. E[Y(1)]}
\item{y1_ub}{the upper bound on the average of Y(1), i.e. E[Y(1)]}
\item{y0_lb}{the lower bound on the average of Y(0), i.e. E[Y(0)]}
\item{y0_ub}{the upper bound on the average of Y(0), i.e. E[Y(0)]}
\item{ate_lb}{estimate of the lower bound on ATE, i.e. E[Y(1) - Y(0)]}
\item{ate_ub}{estimate of the upper bound on ATE, i.e. E[Y(1) - Y(0)]}
\item{ate_rps}{the point estimate of ATE using the reference propensity scores}
\item{se_lb}{standard error for the estimate of the lower bound on ATE}
\item{se_ub}{standard error for the estimate of the upper bound on ATE}
\item{ci_lb}{the lower end point of the confidence interval for ATE}
\item{ci_ub}{the upper end point of the confidence interval for ATE}
}
\description{
Bounds the average treatment effect (ATE) under the unconfoundedness assumption without the overlap condition.
This command is for the case when all the covariates are discrete.
