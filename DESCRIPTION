Description: Estimation and inference methods for bounding average treatment effects (on the treated) that are valid under an unconfoundedness assumption. 
    The bounds are designed to be robust in challenging situations, for example, when the the conditioning variables take on a large number of different values in the observed sample, or when the overlap condition is violated. 
    This robustness is achieved by only using limited "pooling" of information across observations.
