Description: We provide novel bounds on average treatment effects (on the treated) that are valid under an unconfoundedness assumption. 
    Our bounds are applicable if the conditioning variables do not satisfy the overlap condition, are high-dimensional, and take on a large number of different values in the observed sample. 
    This robustness is achieved by only using limited “pooling” of information across observations. 
    Namely, the bounds are constructed as sample averages over functions of the observed outcomes such that the contribution of each outcome only depends on the treatment status of a limited number of observations. 
    No information pooling across observations leads to so-called “Manski bounds”, while unlimited information pooling leads to standard inverse propensity score weighting. 
    For more details, see the paper by Lee and Weidner (2020).
