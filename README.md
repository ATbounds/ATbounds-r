# ATbounds

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

***ATbounds*** is an R package that provides estimation and inference
methods for bounding average treatment effects (on the treated) that are
valid under an unconfoundedness assumption. The bounds are designed to
be robust in challenging situations, for example, when the the
conditioning variables take on a large number of different values in the
observed sample, or when the overlap condition is violated. This
robustness is achieved by only using limited “pooling” of information
across observations.

See Lee and Weidner (2021), “Bounding Treatment Effects by Pooling
Limited Information across Observations,” &lt;arXiv:??? \[econ.EM\]&gt;.
