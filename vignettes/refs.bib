  abstract = {New formulas are given for the minimax linear risk in estimating a linear functional of an unknown object from indirect data contaminated with random Gaussian noise. The formulas cover a variety of loss functions and do not require the symmetry of the convex a priori class. It is shown that affine minimax rules are within a few percent of minimax even among nonlinear rules, for a variety of loss functions. It is also shown that difficulty of estimation is measured by the modulus of continuity of the functional to be estimated. The method of proof exposes a correspondence between minimax affine estimates in the statistical estimation problem and optimal algorithms in the theory of optimal recovery.}

This comparison shows that many of the econometric procedures do not replicate the experimentally determined results, and it suggests that researchers should be aware of the potential for specification errors in other nonexperimental evaluations.}

Let M and p {$>$} k denote positive constants and let U be an open neighborhood of the origin of Rd.

Let L be a linear differential operator of order m on Cm and set T(\texttheta ) = L\texttheta (0) for \texttheta{} {$\in$} {$\Theta$}. Let (X, Y) be a pair of random variables such that X is Rd valued and Y is real valued. It is assumed that the distribution of X is absolutely continuous and that its density is bounded away from zero and infinity on U. The conditional distribution of Y given X is assumed to be (say) normal, with a conditional variance which is bounded away from zero and infinity on U. The regression function of Y on X is assumed to belong to {$\Theta$}. It is shown that r = (p - m)/(2p + d) is the optimal (uniform) rate of convergence for a sequence {\^T}n of estimators of T(\texttheta ) such that {\^T}n is based on a random sample of size n from the distribution of (X, Y). An analogous result is obtained for nonparametric estimators of a density function.}
